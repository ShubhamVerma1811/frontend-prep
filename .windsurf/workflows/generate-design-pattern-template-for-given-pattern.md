The user would provide you with a design pattern name for which the folder and data from template needs to be created.

1. Get the Pattern name from the user.
2. In the design-patterns folder, there are PATTERN_README_TEMPLATE and README.md
3. Go through them and then you'll have to create a new folder under the desgin-patterns folder of the pattern that had user provided.
4. The files and content of the pattern folder would follow from the above provided markdown files.
5. Remember to not populate the actual implementaions of any files, that is for the user to do and learn.
6. In case of any confusion refer other files on the folder or you can ask the user.
