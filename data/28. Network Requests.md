    Navigating Data Fetching Strategies: Network Only, Cache, and Hybrid
    Approaches
  </h1>
  <p>
    Choosing the right data fetching strategy is crucial for the performance and
    user experience of any web application. This article discusses three common
    strategies: Network Only, Network and Cache, and Cache Only, along with
    their advantages and disadvantages.
  </p>
  <h2>Network Only</h2>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fresh Data:</strong> Ensures access to the most up-to-date
      information directly from the server, ideal for real-time data needs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Latency:</strong> Can result in delays due to slow network
      connections or high server load.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Potential for Failure:</strong> Relies entirely on network
      availability; any disruption means no data is received.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Network and Cache</h2>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Balanced Approach:</strong> Offers a compromise between speed
      (cache) and freshness (network).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Immediate response from cache with
      background updates for fresh data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Potential for Stale Data:</strong> The cache might serve outdated
      information until the next network update.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complex Caching Logic:</strong> Requires careful management of
      cache validity and synchronization.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Cache Only</h2>
  <h3>Pros:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Instantaneous Response:</strong> Delivers immediate data retrieval
      if available in the cache.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Risk of Stale Data:</strong> There&#8217;s a high chance of
      serving outdated information if the cache isn&#8217;t regularly refreshed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dependence on Cache:</strong> Excessive reliance on cached data
      can prevent accessing fresh data from the network.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The choice of data fetching strategy should be tailored to the specific
    needs of your application. <strong>Network Only</strong> is best for
    applications requiring real-time data.
    <strong>Network and Cache</strong> offers a balanced solution suitable for
    most use cases. <strong>Cache Only</strong> is ideal for applications where
    data doesn&#8217;t change frequently and speed is paramount.
