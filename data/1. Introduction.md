<p>Welcome to the <strong>Frontend System Design Handbook</strong>.</p>
<p>
  This frontend system design playbook explains exactly what a frontend system
  design interview is, why companies use them, and how to ace yours.
</p>
<p>
  You’ll learn how frontend interviews differ from backend interviews, what
  interviewers care about, how you’ll be graded, and a simple framework
  (<strong>RADIO</strong>) to structure your responses.
</p>
<p>
  This <strong>Frontend System Design Handbook</strong> provides a concise
  overview of the topics we’ll cover in this series, including real-world
  interview questions and key frontend concepts. The handbook will cover both
  fundamental and advanced topics in frontend system design.

<h2>What Is a Frontend System Design Interview?</h2>
<p>
  Frontend system design interviews test your ability to architect large,
  scalable UI systems, not just individual components, but entire frontend
  architectures.
</p>
<p>
  Based on your architectural decisions, companies use these interviews to see
  whether you’re at a junior, mid-level, or senior level.
</p>
<p>Interviewers want to see if you can design frontends that scale across:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User</li>
  <li>Teams</li>
  <li>Feature complexity</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Instead of just building buttons or styling pages, you’ll discuss state
  management, data flow, routing, performance, and UX at scale. Effective
  application state management is crucial in handling data flow and state within
  complex, component-based applications, often utilizing architectural patterns
  and libraries like Flux and Redux.
</p>

<h2>Frontend vs Backend System Design Interviews</h2>
<p>
  If you’ve done system design interviews before, they probably focused on
  <a
    href="https://frontendlead.com/system-design/general-system-design-funamentals"
    >backend</a
  >
  systems: databases, distributed architecture, and API design. Frontend
  interviews have similarities, but their emphasis is different.
</p>
<p>Here’s a comparison:</p>

<h2>What Interviewers Look For</h2>
<p>
  Interviewers want clarity, structure, and transparent decision-making. They’re
  grading you on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you clarify the scope and requirements</li>
  <li>
    Choices in state management and architecture, including how components or
    micro frontends are responsible for specific features or aspects of an
    application
  </li>
  <li>How you handle performance, UX, and scalability trade-offs</li>
  <li>
    Your understanding of modern frontend concepts (SSR vs CSR, caching
    strategies, etc.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between junior and senior answers:</p>

<h2>How You’ll Be Graded</h2>
<p>
  Interviewers typically grade frontend system design interviews across five
  main categories:
</p>
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col />
    <col />
    <col />
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Category</th>

      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
        Did you clearly understand and clarify the problem?
      </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">

      </td>
    </tr>

        Did you choose an appropriate architecture?
      </td>
      <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
        Explained clearly why you chose React Context vs. Redux
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Your goal isn’t just to come up with the “right” answer but to demonstrate
  your thought process and rationale behind each choice. Interviewers will look
  for key points in your responses, such as clarity, structure, and
  decision-making.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>How to Approach the Interview Strategically</h2>
<p><strong>Clarify the Scope First</strong></p>
<p>Always start by clarifying:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User requirements</li>
  <li>Platforms and devices</li>
  <li>Need for offline support</li>
  <li>Real-time requirements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manage Your Time Wisely</strong></p>
<p>Aim to split your interview time like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>20%</strong> Clarifying requirements</li>
  <li><strong>30%</strong> High-level architecture</li>
  <li><strong>30%</strong> Deep dives into key decisions</li>
  <li><strong>20%</strong> Trade-offs and wrap-up</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communicate Trade-Offs</strong></p>
<p>Interviewers expect clear reasoning behind your choices:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    “I chose React Query over Redux because it simplifies data fetching and
    reduces unnecessary re-renders. The trade-off is slightly less centralized
    state management, but it fits this app’s use case.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  When discussing high-level architecture, emphasize how developers utilize
  component-based and modular architectures to develop modular, reusable, and
  optimized software for complex applications. This approach ensures that the
  software can handle complex requirements efficiently and is easier to maintain
  and extend.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Introducing the RADIO Framework</h2>
<p>
  RADIO provides a clear, straightforward way to handle front-end system design
  interviews. Yangshun Tay is credited with making it popular. It covers
  Requirements, Architecture, Dataflow, Interface, and Optimizations. This isn’t
  about memorizing steps or processes. Instead, RADIO helps you organize your
  thoughts, break down complex problems, and communicate your solutions.

  After covering the fundamentals, we’ll walk through realistic frontend design
  scenarios you might see in actual interviews. These include building a
  Facebook-style newsfeed, real-time chat apps, rich text editors,
  Pinterest-like layouts, Google Calendar, and Jira-style boards. Practicing
  these real-world examples will give you confidence in tackling your

<h3>Frontend Fundamentals &amp; Deep Dives</h3>
<p>
  This section goes deeper into specific frontend topics you’ll need to know
  well. We’ll discuss server-side vs client-side rendering, browser security
  issues like XSS and CORS, caching with IndexedDB and Apollo, optimizing
  images, Core Web Vitals, accessibility best practices, network request
  patterns, web protocols, and data normalization. These deep dives will help
  solidify your understanding so you can apply these concepts in your
  interviews.

<h3>Bonus: General System Design Fundamentals</h3>
<p>
  We’ll also discuss

    href="https://frontendlead.com/system-design/general-system-design-fundamentals"

  topics, such as rate limiting, load balancing, and high-level scalability
  principles. You might be asking why, if this is a front-end system design
  guide. There are times when you may be participating in a full-stack
  interview, and the interviewer may ask questions about full-stack concepts, so
  it’s beneficial to have a high-level overview to be prepared.

<h2>Preparation Material</h2>
<p>This series assumes you’re familiar with frontend basics.</p>
<p>If needed, brush up on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>State management (Redux, Context, Zustand)</li>
  <li>React best practices (Hooks, lazy loading)</li>
  <li>API design principles (REST, GraphQL)</li>
  <li>Web performance fundamentals</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Effective resource management is crucial in application development to
  optimize performance and ensure scalability. This handbook will guide you
  through each of these steps.
</p>
<p>
  Projects like building smaller-scale versions of apps like Instagram, Slack,
  or Google Docs can also build intuition and confidence.
</p>
<p>With that, you’re ready to start.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  Next, we’ll move on to <strong>“Requirements” (the R in RADIO)</strong>, and
  I’ll show you exactly how to prepare for success from the start.
