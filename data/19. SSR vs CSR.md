<h1>Server Side Rendering vs Client Side Rendering</h1>
<p>
  Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) are two different
  approaches to rendering web applications, and they each have their own set of
  advantages and disadvantages. Below, I&#8217;ll outline the pros and cons of
  both Server-side rendering and Client-side rendering in the context of React.
</p>
<h3>Server-side Rendering (SSR):</h3>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Initial Page Load: SSR sends a fully rendered page to the client, which
    means that the user can see content sooner because the server generates the
    HTML on the initial request.
  </li>
  <li>
    SEO-Friendly: Search engines can easily crawl and index the content because
    the page is delivered with all the necessary markup. This is particularly
    important for content-heavy applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance for Low-Powered Devices: SSR can perform better on low-powered
    devices or slow network connections because the server sends pre-rendered
    HTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graceful Degradation: If JavaScript fails on the client-side, SSR provides a
    fallback mechanism, ensuring that the user still sees content.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Server Load: SSR can put a higher load on the server because it&#8217;s
    responsible for rendering the page for each request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Complexity: Implementing SSR can be more complex, especially if you have a
    complex application that relies heavily on client-side interactivity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Slower Interactivity: While the initial page load may be faster, subsequent
    interactions may be slower because the client has to make additional
    requests to the server.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Client-side Rendering (CSR):</h3>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Faster Interactivity: Once the initial JavaScript bundle is loaded,
    subsequent interactions can be very fast because the client can update the
    DOM without needing to go back to the server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduced Server Load: The server is primarily responsible for sending the
    initial JavaScript bundle and data. After that, the client handles
    rendering.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rich Client Interactions: CSR is great for applications that rely heavily on
    client-side interactions, as it provides a more dynamic and interactive
    experience.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    Slower Initial Page Load: The initial load time can be slower because the
    client needs to fetch the JavaScript bundle and then render the page on the
    client-side.
  </li>
  <li>
    SEO Challenges: Search engines may have a harder time crawling and indexing
    content because the initial HTML is often minimal and the actual content is
    populated by JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limited Performance on Low-Powered Devices: CSR can be less performant on
    low-powered devices or slow network connections, as they have to do more
    work on the client-side.
  </li>
  <li>
    Potential for Flicker: In some cases, there can be a noticeable flicker or
    delay as the client-side JavaScript renders the page.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>
  Choosing between SSR and CSR depends on the specific requirements of your
  application. If you have a content-heavy site that requires good SEO, SSR
  might be the better choice. However, for highly interactive applications where
  speed of interaction is crucial, CSR may be more suitable. In many cases, a
  hybrid approach (like Next.js with its ability to do both SSR and CSR) can
  provide the best of both worlds.
