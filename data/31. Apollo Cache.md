  <h1>Apollo Client Caching Explained</h1>
  <p>
    Apollo Client, known for its powerful GraphQL handling, incorporates an
    advanced caching system to boost application performance by minimizing
    unnecessary network requests. Below are key features and techniques for
    client-side caching with Apollo:
  </p>
  <section>
    <h2>InMemoryCache</h2>
    <p>
      The default caching solution, <strong>InMemoryCache</strong>, stores
      normalized data in memory to eliminate redundancy and enhance lookup
      speeds.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Normalized Cache</h2>
    <p>
      By breaking down query results into individual objects and storing them
      flatly by unique identifiers, <strong>Normalized Cache</strong> ensures
      efficiency in data updating and retrieval.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Cache Redirects</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cache Redirects</strong> guide Apollo&#8217;s cache to fetch data
      for certain queries from already cached information, even if stored under
      different queries.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Field Policies</h2>
    <p>
      Custom logic for cache operations at the field level can be defined
      through <strong>Field Policies</strong>, allowing for tailored caching
      strategies, pagination, and more.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Cache Eviction and Garbage Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Tools for <strong>Cache Eviction</strong> and
      <strong>Garbage Collection</strong> aid in maintaining an optimal cache
      size by purging unused or stale data.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Persisted Cache</h2>
    <p>
      With <strong>Persisted Cache</strong>, data can be stored in local storage
      or other mediums, enabling quick data retrieval even after application
      restarts.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Optimistic UI</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Optimistic UI</strong> feature allows for instant UI updates
      with hypothetical responses, later corrected by actual server data,
      fostering a seamless user experience.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Fetch Policies</h2>
    <p>
      Diverse <strong>Fetch Policies</strong> like <em>cache-first</em>,
      <em>cache-and-network</em>, and <em>network-only</em> dictate the
      interplay between cache and network requests, providing flexibility in
      data fetching strategies.
    </p>
  </section>
  <p>
    Utilizing these caching capabilities of Apollo Client can significantly
    improve the efficiency and responsiveness of applications built on GraphQL.
