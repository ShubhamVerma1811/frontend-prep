<h1>Web Accessibility Best Practices</h1>
<p>
  Accessibility in web development ensures that websites are usable by people
  with various disabilities. This encompasses a broad range of practices, from
  keyboard navigation and semantic HTML to ARIA roles and responsive design. The
  goal is to make the web inclusive for everyone, regardless of their physical
  or cognitive abilities.
</p>
<h2>Semantic HTML and ARIA</h2>
<p>
  Utilizing semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> clarifies the
  structure and meaning of content, making it easier for assistive technologies
  to interpret. ARIA roles and attributes further enhance the accessibility of
  dynamic content and custom UI components.

      <td>&lt;main&gt;</td>
      <td>Main content of a document</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;article&gt;</td>
      <td>A self-contained composition</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2>Enhancing Accessibility with Alt Text and Keyboard Navigation</h2>
<p>
  Providing descriptive alt text for images ensures that users who cannot see
  them still understand their content. Equally important is enabling keyboard
  navigation for all interactive elements, allowing users without mouse
  capabilities to fully interact with the site.
</p>
<h2>Ensuring Visibility with Focus Styles and Skip Links</h2>
<p>
  Clear focus styles and &#8220;skip to content&#8221; links significantly
  improve the experience for keyboard users, making navigation more intuitive
  and less cumbersome.
</p>
<h2>Form Accessibility and Error Handling</h2>
<p>
  Proper labeling of form elements, along with clear and descriptive error
  messages, ensures that forms are accessible and user-friendly.
</p>
<h2>Color Contrast and Media Accessibility</h2>
<p>
  Maintaining high contrast between text and backgrounds enhances readability,
  while providing captions and transcripts for media ensures inclusivity for
  users with hearing impairments.
</p>
<h2>Responsive Design and Testing</h2>
<p>
  A responsive design adapts to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring
  accessibility across all platforms. Regular testing with screen readers and
  accessibility tools is crucial to identify and address potential barriers.
