<h1>Frontend security &#8211; Frontend System Design Guide</h1>
<p>
  Frontend security is crucial for protecting web applications from various
  types of attacks and vulnerabilities. Here are some of the main frontend
  security features and practices to consider:
</p>
<h3><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources
    from which resources can be loaded, preventing XSS attacks by disallowing
    the execution of malicious scripts.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user inputs to
    ensure they do not contain malicious scripts.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Escape Characters: Encode special characters in user-generated content to
    prevent them from being interpreted as executable code.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    CSRF Tokens: Implement anti-CSRF tokens to ensure that requests originate
    from legitimate and authenticated users.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Same-Site Cookies: Use the <code>SameSite</code> attribute to prevent
    cookies from being sent in cross-origin requests, which can help mitigate
    CSRF attacks.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Clickjacking Protection:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    X-Frame-Options Header: Set the X-Frame-Options header to deny or allow
    specific domains to embed your site in an iframe, preventing clickjacking
    attacks.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Secure Communications:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    HTTPS: Ensure that your site uses HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and
    protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Client-Side Validation: Implement validation on the client-side to catch and
    reject invalid or malicious input before it&#8217;s sent to the server.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Server-Side Validation: Always validate input on the server-side as well, as
    client-side validation can be bypassed.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password requirements to protect
    user accounts.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA to add an extra layer of
    security for user authentication.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use RBAC to ensure that users only have
    access to the resources and functionalities they are authorized to use.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Session Management:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Session Timeout: Set session timeouts to automatically log out inactive
    users and prevent session hijacking.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Session Tokens: Use secure, random session tokens and regenerate them after
    a successful login.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Content Security:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Content-Type Headers: Properly set Content-Type headers to prevent browsers
    from interpreting content in unexpected ways.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    File Upload Security: If your application allows file uploads, validate file
    types and implement proper security measures to prevent malicious uploads.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Error Handling:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Custom Error Messages: Avoid revealing sensitive information in error
    messages. Provide generic error messages to users and log detailed error
    information for developers.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    404 Handling: Customize error pages to avoid leaking information about the
    underlying technology stack.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Dependency Scanning:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Regularly Update Dependencies: Keep frontend libraries and frameworks
    up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.
  </li>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Dependency Scanning Tools: Use tools that scan your project&#8217;s
    dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Content Security Policies (CSP):</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li class="ql-indent-1">
    Strict Mode: Consider implementing CSP in strict mode to limit which
    resources can be loaded by your application.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regularly updating and patching
  your frontend code, staying informed about emerging threats, and conducting
  security audits are essential practices to maintain a secure frontend.
