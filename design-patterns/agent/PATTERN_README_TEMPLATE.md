## üìù Template Usage Notes

**When creating a new pattern README:**

1. **Replace all bracketed placeholders** with pattern-specific content
2. **Customize the examples** to show the most relevant real-world use cases
3. **Adjust the interview questions** based on common industry questions for that pattern
4. **Tailor the exploration challenges** to the pattern's complexity and common variations
5. **Update the related patterns** section based on actual relationships
6. **Modify the recommended reading** to include pattern-specific resources

**Key sections to focus on:**
- **Problem/Solution**: Make it crystal clear WHY this pattern exists
- **Interview Prep**: Include actual questions you might face
- **Exploration**: Progressive challenges that build mastery
- **Real-world examples**: Show practical applications, not toy examples
